          <h2>The Beginning</h2>
          <p>When we got there it was cramped and loud serveal of us where put on to one elevator, but after we got off on to the floor we were sent to it began to get quiet and settle down. So for the first part of the "interview" they answered quesions that Miss Sinclar had brought with her and they answered them in a way even I understood. It seemed as if they enjoyed answering our question I figured it was a good break from there normal set day.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p> After an hour Students began asking there own question they had and the staff there answered them to the best of there ability and tried to help them by giving them places to vist to get more information of how to code in certian laugages. Then they showed us soome of the things they where working on and how finished working on. One was a computer program that would give the ground diffrent chemicals or minreals depending on what that area needed. So after all of that we got together for a picture and then they showed us around there work place. I was most intrested in there photo shoot room they had downstairs. I find that i like taking photos more that coding to be completely honest.</p>

        <h2>The End of the Day</h2>
        <p>After we finished up there we went down the stairs back to the lobby where we got back on they bus and headed to lunch at cookout. I was first in line because i wasnt about to wait in that line i knew was coming in. Food was good and i enjoyed it alot all together it was a pretty fun day much better than speading it at school that for sure. On the way back everyone seemed tried from being out all day but im tried everyday. So when we got back we headed off to our 7th period classes to finish up the day.</p>
